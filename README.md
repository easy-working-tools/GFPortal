## ApFree WiFiDog: A high performance captive portal solution for HTTP(s)

ApFree WiFiDog is an open-source, high-performance captive portal solution for HTTP(s) that can be used to authenticate users on wireless networks running on OpenWrt platform. It can handle high concurrency and high volume of traffic and supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

  user -->> router : 访问www.baidu.com
  activate router
  router ->> user : 拦截该访问跳转指向apfree-wifidog认证服务器wwas
  deactivate router
  user ->> wwas : 用户访问apfree-wifidog认证服务器wwas
  activate wwas
  wwas ->> user : apfree-wifidog认证服务器wwas 返回portal认证页面
  user ->> wwas : 获取短信验证码
  wwas ->> sms  : 调用短信服务器接口使其发送短信验证码
  deactivate wwas
  activate sms
  sms ->> user  : 短信服务器发送短信验证码给用户
  deactivate sms
  user ->> wwas : 用户输入短信验证码验证
  activate wwas
  wwas ->> user : 用户通过认证后，返回认证服务器给用户颁发的token及跳转请求
  deactivate wwas
  user ->> router : 用户根据认证服务器的跳转请求，带着token访问apfree-wifidog的本地认证服务接口
  router ->> wwas : apfree-wifidog根据用户提交的token到认证服务器端验证该token是否为认证服务器颁发
  activate router
  activate wwas
  wwas ->> router : 认证服务器根据提交的token及标识用户的信息，返回认证结果
  deactivate wwas
  deactivate router
  router ->> user : 根据收到的认证结果进行相应的处理流程

The above diagram is a flowchart of the user authentication procedure for apfree-wifidog when used in conjunction with the wwas authentication server and SMS verification. It shows the process of a user attempting to access a website, the router intercepting the request and redirecting the user to the apfree-wifidog authentication server, the user requesting an SMS verification code, the server sending the code to the user, the user inputting the code to verify their identity, and finally being granted access to the website. The diagram also includes loops for the "keep-alive" process and the "apfree-wifidog counter v2" process which involve the router and the authentication server regularly communicating to ensure that the authentication is still valid and to collect statistics on user's online usage.

### User roam procedure

```mermaid

  title: apfree-wifidog漫游时序图
	participant user as 路由器下面的用户
	participant router as 安装了dnsmasq及apfree-wifidog的路由器
  participant wwas as apfree-wifidog 认证服务器
	
	user ->> router : 用户连接到路由器上，通过dnsmasq获取到ip地址
	router ->> wwas	: dnsmasq调用apfree-wifidog的roam接口
	Note left of router : dnsmasq作为dhcp server提供user的mac地址、ip及名称
	Note right of wwas : 认证服务器收到roam接口后，根据mac地址查找该用户是否已经通过了认证
	alt 如果该用户已经通过认证
		wwas ->> router : 将用户的token信息，ip、mac返回，并将该客户放行
	else
		wwas ->> router : 不做处理，后续该user走正常认证上网流程
	end
	
```

The above diagram is a flowchart of the user roam procedure for apfree-wifidog when the user connects to the router. It shows the process of the user connecting to the router and obtaining an IP address via dnsmasq, the router using dnsmasq to call the roam interface of apfree-wifidog, and the authentication server receiving the roam request and checking if the user has been previously authenticated by their MAC address. If the user has been previously authenticated, the authentication server returns the user's token information, IP, and MAC address to the router and grants access. If the user has not been previously authenticated, the authentication server does not take any action, and the user will go through the normal authentication process to gain access.

## Why choose apfree-wifidog

1. Stable - The developers have rewritten all iptables rule using API instead of fork call, which improves the stability of the solution in multithread-fork running environments.

2. Performance - The use of libevent2, which supports epoll, results in better performance than the original wifidog.

3. HTTPs redirect - The solution supports https redirect, which is becoming increasingly important in today's internet environment.

4. MQTT support - The solution supports MQTT, which allows for remote delivery of trusted IP, domain and pan-domain rules.

5. Compatible with wifidog protocol - The solution is compatible with the wifidog protocol, and can relieve pressure on the server-side if enabled.

6. Advanced rules management - The solution supports various rules such as MAC address based temporary pass, IP, domain, pan-domain, white-list, black-list and all of these rules can be applied without restarting the wifidog.


## How to use

To use apfree-wifidog, you need to first build and configure an auth server. Once you have your auth server set up, you can configure apfree-wifidog to use it by setting the auth server's IP or domain as the location of your auth server in the apfree-wifidog configuration file.

### Build apfree-wifidog Auth server

you can then build and configure your auth server using the official auth server provided by apfree-wifidog developers [wwas](https://github.com/liudf0716/wwas).

When using apfree-wifidog to redirect HTTPS requests, it is important to note that the SSL certificate presented by the captive portal may be considered "illegal" or "untrusted" by the client device. This is because the certificate is generated by the captive portal and is not signed by a trusted certificate authority.

This warning can be safely ignored as it is a normal response when using a captive portal solution. The client device is simply warning the user that the certificate presented by the captive portal may not be trusted. The user can proceed to access the network by choosing to proceed despite the warning.
